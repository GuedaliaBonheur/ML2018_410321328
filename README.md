<h3 align="center"> Homework1 : Image Decryption by a Single-Layer Neural Network </h3>


    This hw was about encrypting and decrypting images. In this hw we were asked to use a single_Layer Neural network to encrypt or decrypt. However we did not use the key1 and key2 image files for encryption but instead a keyGenerator function that provides the encryption key.
